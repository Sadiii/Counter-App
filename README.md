# Counter App

This is a very basic counter app, We can increase and decrease the count. And there are also counter steps like increment by 2 or decrement by 3. 
For building this app, i have used [nextjs13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) framework of [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is based on Javascript. And for the user interface i'm using [Chakra Ui](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-guide). Theese are hot tehnologies.


## Features

- increase a count
- decrease a count
- increase or decrease by 2 steps
- increase or decrease by 3 steps



## Deployment

The todo app is deployed on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/). 
You can check it [here](https://counterapp-amber.vercel.app/)

## Use the Projects

You can clone repository by running the following the command.

```bash
  git clone <repo url>
```
And after locating to the app folder, run the project on your local machine by using the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
Then install all required dependencies
But you must need to install node js in your local machine because we are running typescript outside browser. So nodejs will act as a transalation engine.
```bash
 npm i
```

You will notice that the project file names are with extension of .tsx. it's because we are using typescript flavour. 

You can Futher perform optimization publish the project on [vercel](https://vercel.com/) using the following command.
```bash
 vercel
```
